### 模板 1A：IT 管理员公告 <a href="#template-1a-it-administrator-announcement" id="template-1a-it-administrator-announcement"></a>

> 💡**示例**
>
> **When**: Use to inform your IT team about their role in the rollout
>
> **Subject**: URGENT: New security initiative - Your role in protecting \[company] from credential attacks
>
> Hello \[company] IT administrators,
>
> **The situation**\
> \
> This year, businesses like ours are losing an average of $6 million a year to credential stuffing attacks - where attackers use compromised passwords to break into systems. Scan the news on what happened at Levi’s, Amtrak, 23andMe – in each case, employees through their passwords were secure, having no idea that reusing credentials was the equivalent of giving attackers access to everything.&#x20;
>
> **Our solution**\
> \
> We're implementing Bitwarden Password Manager company-wide to transform how we handle our most vulnerable security layer: credentials.
>
> **Your critical role**\
> \
> You'll be our security champions, helping colleagues move from password chaos to password confidence. This isn't just a software rollout. You're enabling every employee to work securely without the daily frustration of forgotten passwords and locked accounts.
>
> **What makes this different**\
> \
> Bitwarden doesn't just store passwords. It generates strong and unique ones, makes secure login faster than insecure login, enables secure sharing, and helps us keep \[company name] more secure.&#x20;
>
> **Your next steps**
>
> 1. \[Insert company-preferred onboarding workflow]
> 2. Join our admin training sessions (you'll see firsthand how this transforms the user experience)
>
> **Admin training sessions:**
>
> * Option 1: \[event details]
> * Option 2: \[event details]
>
> You're not just implementing a tool. You're giving every employee superpowers against cyber threats.
>
> Thank you, \

### 模板 1B：领导团队公告 <a href="#template-1b-leadership-team-announcement" id="template-1b-leadership-team-announcement"></a>

> 💡**示例**
>
> **When**: Use to inform senior leadership about the rollout and request their advocacy
>
> **Subject**: Your leadership needed: Preventing the $4.8M mistake
>
> Dear Leadership Team,
>
> **The wake-up call**
>
> This year, credential stuffing attacks are costing businesses an average of $6 million annually in direct losses, regulatory fines, and reputation damage. These aren’t sophisticated nation-state attacks – they were preventable breaches caused by employees reusing simple passwords across multiple systems. When one credential gets compromised, attackers gain access to everything - financial systems, customer databases, intellectual property, and more.&#x20;
>
> **The uncomfortable truth**
>
> This could happen to us tomorrow. Our employees are juggling countless passwords, writing them on sticky notes, or reusing "variations" like Password1!, Password2!, Password3!.
>
> **The transformation**
>
> Starting \[date], we're implementing Bitwarden Password Manager. This isn't just about security. It's about giving every employee the confidence to work securely online.
>
> **Why your visible leadership matters**
>
> * Employees watch what leadership does, not just what we say
> * When you mention using Bitwarden in meetings, it signals this matters
> * Your advocacy transforms this from "IT requirement" to "business priority"
>
> **What this means for our business**
>
> * Eliminate password-related help desk tickets
> * Reduce breach risk by 95% according to industry studies
> * Free up 30+ hours per employee annually from password struggles
>
> **Your role**
>
> 1. Model the behavior: Use Bitwarden yourself and mention it naturally
> 2. Champion in meetings: "I love how Bitwarden lets me focus on leadership instead of wrestling with passwords"
> 3. Support the transition: Encourage participation in training
>
> **Next steps**
>
> * Your Bitwarden invitation: \[timeframe]
> * Executive briefing: \[date/time]
> * Company-wide launch: \[date]
>
> This is our chance to turn our biggest security vulnerability into our competitive advantage.
>
> Best, \
> \[Sender's name and title]

>
> **Subject**: Finally! No more "forgot password" frustration - Meet Bitwarden
>
> Hello everyone,
>
> **Picture this scenario**
>
> It's Monday morning. You're trying to log into three different systems to start your day. The first password doesn't work—was it Password123 or Password124? The second system locks you out after three attempts. By the time IT resets everything, you've lost 20 minutes and your momentum for the day.
>
> Sound familiar? You're not alone. The average employee spends 12 minutes daily wrestling with passwords and gets locked out of systems 3 times per month.
>
> **The game-changer**
>
> Starting \[date], we're giving everyone at \[company] a digital superpower: Bitwarden Password Manager.
>
> **What this means for your daily life**

> * Login to anything in 2 seconds - Bitwarden fills passwords instantly
> * Never forget another password - It remembers everything securely
> * Stop reusing weak passwords - generate strong and unique ones effortlessly

>
> * Setup invitation coming \[timeframe]
> * Training session: \[date/time]
> * Full deployment: \[date]
>
> Get ready to transform your relationship with passwords from frustration to confidence.
