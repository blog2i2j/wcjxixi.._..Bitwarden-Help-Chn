## 邀请您的用户 <a href="#invite-your-users" id="invite-your-users"></a>

> **示例**
>
> **Subject**: 2 ways to automate Bitwarden user provisioning
>
> **Body**:
>
> Hi _\[name]_,
>
> Scalable success with Bitwarden comes from provisioning users smoothly and securely. Here are the top ways new admins and owners automate the process of getting employees on Bitwarden.
>
> **SSO**
>
> With Login with SSO, Enterprise organizations leverage their existing Identity Provider to authenticate users with Bitwarden using the SAML 2.0 or OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocols. [Learn about SSO](https://bitwarden.com/help/configure-sso-saml/).
>
> **SCIM**
>
> System for cross-domain identity management (SCIM) can be used to automatically provision members and groups in your Bitwarden organization. Bitwarden servers provide a SCIM endpoint that, with a valid SCIM API key, will accept requests from your Identity Provider (IdP) for user and group provisioning and de-provisioning. [Learn about SCIM](https://bitwarden.com/help/about-scim/).
>
> **Directory Connector**
>
> The Bitwarden Directory Connector app automatically provisions users, groups, and group associations in your Bitwarden organization by pulling from a selection of source directory services. Provisioned users will be issued invitations to join the organization. [Learn about Directory Connector](https://bitwarden.com/help/directory-sync/).
