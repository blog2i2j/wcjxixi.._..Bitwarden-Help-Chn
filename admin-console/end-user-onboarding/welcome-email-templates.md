以下电子邮件模板可在 Bitwarden 密码管理器推出时发送给您的最终用户。确保将占位符文本（例如 _\[Event details]_）替换为特定于您的企业的信息。

> **示例**
>
> **To**: All end-users
>
> **Subject**: Introducing Bitwarden Password Manager - new security and productivity tool
>
> **Body**:
>
> Hello everyone,
>
> We are happy to announce the deployment of Bitwarden Password Manager for everyone at \[company].
>
> A password manager is a very important tool for staying secure online. Bitwarden generates, saves, and then autofills strong passwords for you, so that you don’t have to remember or type any passwords. Importantly, this makes it easy to have passwords that are unique to every website and app that you log into, which is the best way to stay secure and protect against a data breach. A weak or reused password is a vulnerable entry point for hackers to hurt our business through data breaches, ransomware, or other attacks.
>
> It’s easy to import any passwords that you have saved in your web browser or other solution, so you can get started practicing secure password habits today.
>
> To get started, follow these steps:
>
> _\[Insert company-preferred_ [_onboarding workflow_](https://bitwarden.com/help/onboarding-workflows/)_]_
>
> Your administrator will help to make sure you have access to the correct shared password collections.
>
> **Resources and training**
>
> To help you be successful with password management, training is available for users:
>
> Training session option 1: _\[Event details]_
>
> Training session option 2: _\[Event details]_
>
> Visit the [Bitwarden learning page](https://bitwarden.com/learning/getting-started-password-manager/) for video demos and setup guides. More about Bitwarden can be found at [bitwarden.com](https://bitwarden.com/) within their extensive [documentation](https://bitwarden.com/help/).
